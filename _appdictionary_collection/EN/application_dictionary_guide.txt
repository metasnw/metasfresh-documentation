preliminary
you need to have:
- metasfresh stack running db, webapi and app server at least
- db access 
- java client with access to db
- ID server setup when you want to contribute your scripts


you need to understand these concepts:
- elements 
- Layers: DB, AD Table and Column, AD Window, Tab, Field, UI layout 
- 

you need to know:
- how to use the zoom feature in java client 
- how to run processes in java client 
- how to navigate through records in java client 

## Create AD Table 
- open Window "Table and Column"
- start search 
- switch to single view
- click on new record
- put a table name. That name will be used for creating the db table.
- name = puty friendly name
- berechtigungsstufe = client + org
- copy from columns from table
- pick "table Template"
- system columns are copied 
- zoom into element
- create new element 
- columname= db column name
- name = name to be displayed to the user
- go back to table and column
- select element 
- save
- create your own columns 

## Create Database Table
- run process "synchronize columns"
- now the table and columns are created in postgres

## create a window with a tab linking to your new table
- open window management
- create new tab 
- select table that you created before
- run process create column from table



run this to allow writing data to the new table.
it will create a sequence for the new primary key column
